abstract = "The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic interrelation among agronomic characters associated with wheat grain yield of the main Brazilian cultivated genotypes through path analysis in two environments. The tests were conducted in Tenente Portela-RS and Braga-RS. The experimental design was randomized blocks arranged in factorial scheme, 2 locations × 17 genotypes and 3 repetitions. The evaluated characters were plant height, main stem spike mass, tiller spikes mass, main stem spike grains number, tiller spikes grains number, main stem spike grains mass, tiller spikes grains mass, mass of a thousand grains and grain yield. Path analysis was performed for characters associated with grain yield. The results show that main stem spike grains mass, main stem spike grains number, and tiller spikes grains mass have direct effects on grain yield. Larger main stem spike grains mass, main stem spike grains number, and tiller spikes grains mass should be considered for achieving genotypes of high grain yield potential."
