abstract = "The aims of this study were to characterize black oat populations by estimating between- and within-populations variance components and genetic parameters, as well as to distinguish the populations using multivariable statistics. The experiment was carried out in randomized blocks design with three repetitions, with 14 black oat populations collected in several municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul state. Agronomic important traits were assessed at physiological maturation stage. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated considering within-block information. In addition, Mahalanobis distance, relative contribution of traits, and canonical variables were used to distinguish the populations. Selection based on panicle length, number of grains per panicle, panicle weight and panicle grain weight may result in higher selection gains. Panicle grain weight presents a greater contribution to genetic divergence between studied populations. The formation of distinct groups indicated the presence of genetic variability among black oat populations in the northwestern of the Rio Grande do Sul state. Directed crosses between individual plants of populations from (i) Alto Alegre and Salvador das Miss\\~oes, Chapada, or Santa Rosa or (ii) between plants of populations from Salvador das Miss\\~oes and Campos Borges or Santa Rosa can generate segregating populations with great genetic variability. The predominance of between-phenotypic variance and a within-genetic variance indicate prospects for success in selection gain and possible selection of a new cultivar with fewer efforts compared to a cross-based method. This is supported by the high values of within-population heritability."
