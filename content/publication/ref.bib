	abstract = {ABSTRACT A large set of variables is assessed for progeny selection in a plant-breeding program and other agronomic fields. The meta-analysis of the coefficient of variation (CVe) produces information for researchers and breeders on the experimental quality of trials. This analysis can also be applied in the decision-making process of the experimental plan regarding the experimental design, the number of repetitions, and the treatments and plants/progenies to be measured. In this study, we evaluated the dataset distribution and the descriptive statistics of CVe through the Frequentist and Bayesian approaches, aiming to establish the credibility and confidence intervals. We submitted CVe data of ten wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) traits reported in 1,068 articles published to the Bayesian and Frequentist analyses. Sample data were analyzed via Gamma and normal models. We selected the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value, and then we tested three link functions. In the Bayesian analysis, uniform distributions were used as non-informative priors for the Gamma distribution parameters with three ranges of q{\textasciitilde}U (a,b,). Thus, the prior probability density function was given by: pθ =1β-α, θ ∈ α,β. The Bayesian and Frequentist approaches with the Gamma model presented similar results for CVe; however, the range Bayesian credible intervals was narrower than the Frequentist confidence intervals. Gamma distribution fitted the CVe data better than the normal distribution. The credible and confidence intervals of CVe were successfully applied to wheat traits and could be used as experimental accuracy measurements in other experiments.},

The objective of this work was to estimate the phenotypic (rp), genotypic (rg) and environmental (re) correlation coefficients and the genetic parameters, as well as to estimate the selection gains between agronomic traits in wheat using multivariate analysis. F6 generation was carried out in a randomized block experimental design, with fifteen wheat genotypes arranged in three replications. The traits measured were days of emergence to flowering, plant height, number of tillers, spike length, number of spikelets, kernel weight and thousand kernel weight. Correlation coefficients, variance components, genetic parameters, selection gain, Euclidiana’s distance, relative contribution of traits and canonical variables were estimated. Selection based on number of tillers, kernel weight and thousand kernel weight may result in expressive selection gains. The number of fertile tillers per plant showed a significant and positive intermediate association with kernel weight and positive correlation with number of spikelets. The cycle showed greater contribution to the genetic divergence among genotypes studied. Distinct groups highlighted the genetic variability among genotypes.},

	abstract = {Under global climate changes, understanding climate variables that are most associated with environmental kinships can contribute to improving the success of hybrid selection, mainly in environments with high climate variations. The main goal of this study is to integrate envirotyping techniques and multi-trait selection for mean performance and the stability of maize genotypes growing in the Huanghuaihai plain in China. A panel of 26 maize hybrids growing in 10 locations in two crop seasons was evaluated for 9 traits. Considering 20 years of climate information and 19 environmental covariables, we identified four mega-environments (ME) in the Huanghuaihai plain which grouped locations that share similar long-term weather patterns. All the studied traits were significantly affected by the genotype × mega-environment × year interaction, suggesting that evaluating maize stability using single-year, multi-environment trials may provide misleading recommendations. Counterintuitively, the highest yields were not observed in the locations with higher accumulated rainfall, leading to the hypothesis that lower vapor pressure deficit, minimum temperatures, and high relative humidity are climate variables that –under no water restriction– reduce plant transpiration and consequently the yield. Utilizing the multi-trait mean performance and stability index (MTMPS) prominent hybrids with satisfactory mean performance and stability across cultivation years were identified. G23 and G25 were selected within three out of the four mega-environments, being considered the most stable and widely adapted hybrids from the panel. The G5 showed satisfactory yield and stability across contrasting years in the drier, warmer, and with higher vapor pressure deficit mega-environment, which included locations in the Hubei province. Overall, this study opens the door to a more systematic and dynamic characterization of the environment to better understand the genotype-by-environment interaction in multi-environment trials.},

abstract = {Guar, the most popular vegetable, is tolerant of drought and is a valuable industrial crop enormously grown across India, Pakistan, USA, and South Africa for pharmaceutically and cosmetically usable galactomannan (gum) content present in seed endosperm. Guar genotypes with productive traits which could perform better in differential environmental conditions are of utmost priority for genotype selection. This could be achieved by employing multivariate trait analysis. In this context, Multi-Trait Stability Index (MTSI) and Multi-Trait Genotype-Ideotype Distance Index (MGIDI) were employed for identifying high-performing genotypes exhibiting multiple traits. In the current investigation, 85 guar accessions growing in different seasons were assessed for 15 morphological traits. The results obtained by MTSI and MGIDI indexes revealed that, out of 85, only 13 genotypes performed better across and within the seasons, and, based on the coincidence index, only three genotypes (IC-415106, IC-420320, and IC-402301) were found stable with high seed production in multi-environmental conditions. View on strengths and weakness as described by the MGIDI reveals that breeders concentrated on developing genotype with desired traits, such as quality of the gum and seed yield. The strength of the ideal genotypes in the present work is mainly focused on high gum content, short crop cycle, and high seed yield possessing good biochemical traits. Thus, MTSI and MGIDI serve as a novel tool for desired genotype selection process simultaneously in plant breeding programs across multi-environments due to uniqueness and ease in interpreting data with minimal multicollinearity issues.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Mixed models and multivariate analysis are powerful tools for selecting superior genotypes in plant breeding programs. The BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) method has been used to predict genetic values without environmental effects. Furthermore, the FAI-BLUP (ideotype-design index) procedure is especially valuable for plant breeding because of multiple-trait selection. This study aimed to determine the genetic potential of advanced wheat generations using REML/BLUP in combination with multivariate techniques for the selection of superior genotypes. The experiment consisted of eleven wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with three replications. Plant height, spike insertion height, number of tillers, number of spikelets, kernel width, hectoliter weight and kernel weight per plant were determined. The genetic parameters were estimated using the REML/BLUP methodology, and the FAI-BLUP index was calculated using predicted genetic values. The genotypes UFSMFW 1-02, UFSMFW 1-05 and UFSMFW 1-04 show potential to increase the grain yield. The selection gains for number of tillers (14.63 {\%}) and kernel weight per plant (22.35 {\%}) indicate the potential to select superior genotypes.},

abstract = {Image analysis based on color thresholding is the reference method for measuring severity as percent area affected. It is deemed to produce accurate results, usually considered the “true” severity value. More than a dozen applications have been used for the task in phytopathometry studies, but none was coded in R language. Here we introduced and evaluated pliman, a suite for the analysis of plant images. In particular, we show functions for computing percent severity based on RGB information contained in image palettes prepared by the user. Six image collections, totaling 249 images, from different diseases (wheat tan spot, soybean rust, olive leaf spot, rice brown spot, bean angular spot, and Xyllela fastidiosa on tobacco) exhibiting a range of symptomatic patterns and severity were used to evaluate the agreement of pliman predictions with measures by three other software: APS Assess, LeafDoctor, and ImageJ. Three users independently prepared three image palettes (each representing leaf background, symptomatic, or healthy leaf tissue) by manually inspecting and subsetting these target areas of the images. Pliman predictions by a joint palette (by joining images by the three users into one) were highly concordant ($\rho$c {\textgreater} 0.98) with measures by the other software for all but Xylella fastidiosa on tobacco ($\rho$c = 0.49). The error for the latter may be due to the low contrast between symptomatic and healthy tobacco tissues. Users showed to be a source of variation in the overall concordance depending on the disease. Reduction in the image resolution ({\textless} 1 megapixel) did not impact the results. Combined with parallel processing, the use of low image resolution (1078 × 680) decreased processing time, resulting in pliman being {\~{}} 150 to {\~{}} 700 times faster than existing tools for disease quantification. Pliman showed great potential to produce accurate measures and accelerate studies involving plant disease severity measurements, especially for the batch processing of large sets of image collections.},

We investigated genetic diversity in tropical wheat germplasm, discussed the main trends in breeding programs and selected potential parents. Therefore, a trial with 90 commercial cultivars released in Brazil between 1800-2000 and 2001-2019 was conducted during the 2020 winter crop, at the Federal University Vi{\c{c}}osa - UFV in Vi{\c{c}}osa, MG, Brazil. The following traits were evaluated: spike height (SH) and plant height (PH), heading date (HD), spike weight (SW), grain mass per spike (GMS), 100-grain mass (M100), number of spikelets per spike (NSS), number of grains per spike (NGS), hectoliter weight (HW), and grain yield (GY). The data were subjected to REML/BLUP analysis and used to calculate the standardized average Euclidean distance and then UPGMA clusters were generated from the genotypic distance matrix. The selection of the genotypes with the best performance in each phase was accomplished using the multi-trait genotype-ideotype distance index (MGIDI). High genetic diversity was observed between the genotypes evaluated. Multi-trait index revealed selection gain in the desired direction in the two phases. The present study will support the efficient use of the genetic variability present in tropical wheat germplasm. Three genotypes were selected by MGIDI in the first phase, while in the second phase 12 were selected. Two groups of dissimilar and potential genotypes were proposed to compose a partial diallel.

abstract = {Experiments measuring the interaction between genotypes and environments measure the spatial (e.g., locations) and temporal (e.g., years) separation and/or combination of these factors. The genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is very important in plant breeding programs. Over the past six decades, the propensity to model the GEI led to the development of several models and mathematical methods for deciphering GEI in multi-environmental trials (METs) called {\&}ldquo;stability analyses{\&}rdquo;. However, its size is hidden by the contribution of improved management in the yield increase, and for this reason comparisons of new with old varieties in a single experiment could reveal its real size. Due to the existence of inherent differences among proposed methods and analytical models, it is necessary for researchers that calculate stability indices, and ultimately select the superior genotypes, to dissect their usefulness. Thus, we have collected statistics, as well as models and their equations, to explore these methods further. This review introduces a complete set of parametric and non-parametric methods and models with a selection pattern based on each of them. Furthermore, we have aligned each method or statistic with a matched software, macro codes, and/or scripts.},

Here, we show how the multi-trait stability index (MTSI) can be used to select maize hybrids for mean performance and stability of multiple traits. A set of 10 traits, including grain yield (GY), yield components, and plant-related traits with negative and positive desired selection gains (SGs), were accessed in 90 F1 hybrids conducted in multi-environment trials. Hybrid and hybrid × location interaction effects were significant (p ≤.001) for all analyzed traits. The MTSI provided positive gains for all the four traits that were wanted to increase (2.52{\%} ≤ SG ≤ 4.86; mean, 3.28{\%}), including GY (SG, 4.86{\%}), and negative gains for all the six traits that were wanted to decrease (–20.28{\%} ≤ SG ≤ –0.09{\%}; mean, –6.70{\%}), including tassel branch number (SG, –20.28{\%}) and plant height (SG, –1.2{\%}). We also observed desired gains for the stability of all traits. Direct and univariate selection for GY solely was not efficient to provide desired gains for all traits. The MTSI provides a unique, robust, and easy-to-handle selection process that allows identifying the strengths and weaknesses of hybrids. The index was found to be a powerful tool to develop better selection strategies, optimizing the use of resources and time, thus contributing to the sustainability of maize breeding programs worldwide.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multivariate data are common in biological experiments and using the information on multiple traits is crucial to make better decisions for treatment recommendations or genotype selection. However, identifying genotypes/treatments that combine high performance across many traits has been a challenger task. Classical linear multi-trait selection indexes are available, but the presence of multicollinearity and the arbitrary choosing of weighting coefficients may erode the genetic gains. RESULTS: We propose a novel approach for genotype selection and treatment recommendation based on multiple traits that overcome the fragility of classical linear indexes. Here, we use the distance between the genotypes/treatment with an ideotype defined a priori as a multi-trait genotype-ideotype distance index (MGIDI) to provide a selection process that is unique, easy-to-interpret, free from weighting coefficients and multicollinearity issues. The performance of the MGIDI index is assessed through a Monte Carlo simulation study where the percentage of success in selecting traits with desired gains is compared with classical and modern indexes under different scenarios. Two real plant datasets are used to illustrate the application of the index from breeders and agronomists' points of view. Our experimental results indicate that MGIDI can effectively select superior treatments/genotypes based on multi-trait data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and helping practitioners to make better strategic decisions toward an effective multivariate selection in biological experiments. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available in the R package metan (https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/metan) under the function mgidi(). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {In plant breeding, the dialelic models univariate have aided the selection of parents for hybridization. Multivariate analyses allow combining and associating the multiple pieces of information of the genetic relationships between traits. Therefore, multivariate analyses might refine the discrimination and selection of the parents with greater potential to meet the goals of a plant breeding program. Here, we propose a method of multivariate analysis used for stablishing mega-traits (MTs) in diallel trials. The proposed model is applied in the evaluation of a multi-environment complete diallel trial with 90 F1's of simple maize hybrids. From a set of 14 traits, we demonstrated how establishing and interpreting MTs with agronomic implication. The diallel analyzes based on mega-traits present an important evolution in statistical procedures since the selection is based on several traits. We believe that the proposed method fills an important gap of plant breeding. In our example, three MTs were established. The first, formed by plant stature-related traits, the second by tassel size-related traits, and the third by grain yield-related traits. Individual and joint diallel analysis using the established MTs allowed identifying the best hybrid combinations for achieving F1's with lower plant stature, tassel size, and higher grain yield.},

abstract = {Strawberry is an economically and socially important crop in several regions worldwide. Thus, studies that provide information on topics in strawberry growth are important and must be constantly updated. The aims of this study were to fit a logistic growth model to describe strawberry fruit production and to estimate the partial derivatives of the fitted model in order to estimate and interpret the critical points, in addition to using multivariate analyses. To do this, data on 16 treatments [combinations of two cultivars (Albion and Camarosa), two origins (national and imported), and four mixed organic substrates (70{\%} crushed sugar cane residue + 30{\%} organic compost, 70{\%} crushed sugar cane residue + 30{\%} commercial substrate, 70{\%} burnt rice husk + 30{\%} organic compost, and 70{\%} burnt rice husk + 30{\%} commercial substrate)] conducted in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replicates were used. A logistic model was fitted to the accumulated fruit production stratified by treatment and replication. Partial derivatives related to the accumulated thermal sum were estimated in order to quantify the critical points of the model. Subsequently, a principal component analysis was performed. The results show that the use of growth models substantially increases the inferences that can be made about crop growth, and the multivariate analysis summarizes this information, simplifying its interpretation. Approaches such as those carried out in this study are still rarely used, but, compared to simpler models, they increase the amount of inferences that can be made and provide greater elucidation of the results.},

abstract = {Canonical correlations analyzes are being used in the agrarian sciences and constitute an important tool in the interpretation of results. This analysis is performed by complicated mathematical equations and it is only possible to use it thanks to the development of computational software, which allow different interpretations of results, and it is up to the researcher to choose according to his knowledge. Canonical correlations can be interpreted using canonical weights, canonical loadings, or canonical cross-loadings. In Brazil, most of the works that use these analyzes interpret the canonical weights. Therefore, this study aims to show, through an analysis of canonical correlations, the best way to interpret the results, so that they are presented in the most reliable way possible. Data from an experiment with two cultivars of biquinho pepper seeded in 5 light spectrums were performed. The variables were root length and volume, plant height, number of leaves, fresh shoot and root mass, shoot dry mass. Two groups of variables were organized, the multicollinearity was determined through the condition number and the inflation factor of the variance. Canonical correlations analysis was carried out, and weights, loadings, and canonical cross-loadings were estimated for the interpretation of the results. After the interpretations, it was defined that the canonical cross-loadings should be preferred for the interpretation of the canonical correlations. Weights or canonical coefficients provide dubious results of relationships between groups of characters and should be avoided.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate the coefficient of repeatability and the number of measurements required for production and quality variables in a strawberry crop. An experiment was conducted with two strawberry cultivars from two origins grown in four substrate mixtures, totaling 16 treatments, evaluated in a randomized block design with four replications. Mass (MF) and number (NF) of fruits per plant were evaluated as measures of production, and total soluble solids (SST), titratable acidity (AT) and firmness (FIR) of fruits during the crop cycle were evaluated as measures of quality. Subsequently, the repeatability coefficient was estimated by the following methods: analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis using a correlation matrix (PCcor), principal component analysis using a variance-covariance matrix (PCcov) and structural analysis (SA). The number of measurements was adjusted for each studied variable based on determination coefficients of 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, and 0.95. The repeatability coefficients ranged from low to medium. The ANOVA method gave the lowest r values, while the PCcov method presented the highest values of r. When using the PCcov method, 3.6, 2.9, 6.2, 3.2, and 3.8 measurements were needed to reach 80{\%} confidence for the variables MF, NF, SST, AT, and FIR, respectively, and this increased to 7.3, 14.0, 29.6, 15.4, and 18.1 for 95{\%} confidence in the results for MF, NF, SST, AT, and FIR, respectively.},

For this, a 2x3 factorial experiment was conducted with two cultivars of biquinho pepper (BRS Moema and Airetama biquinho) in three growing seasons (E1: October 2015, E2: November 2015, E3: January 2016). The logistic non-linear model for fruit mass was specified as a function of the accumulated thermal sum, and the critical points were calculated through the partial derivatives of the model, in order to characterize the productive performance of the crop by the biological interpretation of the estimates of the three set parameters. In E3, temperatures close to 0 {\textordmasculine}C during the experiment were lethal to the plants, and a linear regression model was used in this case. The production of the cultivars in E1 and E2 were well characterized by the estimated logistic models, and the most productive cultivar was Airetama biquinho in all evaluated seasons. This cultivar also presented higher concentration of production. The two cultivars did not differ significantly with regards to productive precocity. For E3, it was not possible to interpret the parameters in the same way as for E1 and E2, since the use of the linear model did not allow the same interpretations performed for the nonlinear model, reaffirming its applicability horticultural crops of multiple harvests.},

Therefore, solar radiation levels may modify the biomass accumulation and bromatological composition. Different solar radiation levels (100{\%}, 70{\%} and 50{\%} of available solar radiation) were simulated in order to determine crop responses to these factors in chicory (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum). A hydroponic experiment was conducted in an experimental greenhouse in the city of Frederico Westphalen, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Plants grown in lower solar radiation levels are more efficient in converting solar radiation into dry matter, had a higher lipid content, increased chlorophyll indices a, b and total, as well as reduced leaf thickness, acid detergent fiber, cellulose, and lignin content, presenting more attractive bromatological features for commercial production. In this study it was demonstrated that the use of shading screens is an effective method to attenuate the solar radiation, this is especially relevant in places or seasons where there is high light intensity, which contribute to achieve better characteristics of the chicory produced.},

In this paper, we present a summary of the functions implemented in metan and how they integrate into a workflow to explore and analyse MET data.

High heritability of spike weight, number of kernels, and total kernel weight resulted in the best direct selection gains.

abstract = {The implementation of a network of maize trials is an onerous task, so breeding programs seek to eliminate redundant environments, remaining only contrasting ones. The objective was to perform the homogeneous environment grouping by studying the G{\&}times;E interaction through different environmental stratification methods, as well as to compare the efficiency of these methods. Four methods were used: environmental dissimilarity (Djj); Decomposition of the genotype {\&}times; environment interaction (G{\&}times;E) into simple and complex parts by Cruz and Castoldi; Pearson correlation coefficient; and factor analysis. Twenty-five single-cross corn hybrids and three commercial cultivars were tested in eight cultivation environments in a randomized complete block design with three replicates in the evaluation of grain yield. Quedas do Igua{\&}ccedil;u and Cascavel can be reduced into only one test environment by methods of factor analysis and Pearson correlation. The environments of Pato Branco and Amp{\&}eacute;re are grouped by two of the four methods employed. However, Clevel{\&}acirc;ndia, Londrina, and Coxilha do not group with other environments in three of the four methods, and Itapiranga in two of the four methods. Cruz and Castoldi{\&}rsquo;s method and stratification by factor analysis are more rigorous in grouping criteria.},

abstract = {The plot size estimation is based on uniformity trials, however little is known about and how the size of uniformity trial affects the estimate of the plot size. That way, the aim of this study was to determine the influence of uniformity trial size on the estimation of plot size in the eggplant crop. Two uniformity trials were performed with the eggplant culture in a plastic tunnel. The fresh mass of fruit and number of fruits were assessed in six harvests, with a seven-day interval between harvests. For each trial (Tunnel 1 and 2), 25 uniformity trials of different sizes were simulated (3, 4, 5, {\&}hellip; 28 BEU) per harvest and harvest row (individual and grouped) since they presented heteroscedasticity. For each planned uniformity trial, bootstrap procedure was used to estimate 3,000 plot sizes by the maximum coefficient of variation curvature method. The mean and 95{\%} confidence interval width was calculated by the difference between the 97.5th and 2.5th percentiles. The AIC95{\%} and plot size averages were higher in individual harvests than grouped harvests. As the size of the simulated uniformity trial increased, it was verified a reduction of the AIC95{\%} of the plot size. However, the mean plot size did not change with increasing uniformity trial size. In this way, it is possible to state that the size of the uniformity trial affects accuracy the plot size estimation because trials with few numbers of basic experimental units present high experimental variability and inaccurate estimates.},

Studies on sunflower cultivar selection are important for crop expansion, contributing to better cultivar adaptation to different environments. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the linear relations among sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) morphological traits in a subtropical region with lower elevations and to identify traits that may assist in cultivar selection based on agronomic performance and path analysis. The experiment was performed during the 2017/2018 agricultural year in Santa Maria (latitude 29{\&}ordm;71{\&}prime; S, longitude 53{\&}ordm;70{\&}prime; W and 90 m altitude), southern Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replicates and eight cultivars: Syn 045, BRS 323, BRS G58, BRS G59, BRS G60, BRS G61, Multissol 02 and Catissol 03. Assessed traits were plant height, stem diameter, head diameter, thousand achenes weight, yield of achenes per head and number of achenes per head. Hereafter, associations between morphological traits and achene yield were verified by means of linear relations and path analysis. Thousand achenes weight and number of achenes per head exhibited linear relations and direct effects on achene yield in subtropical region at lower elevations. Head diameter does not present direct effect on achenes yield but it has direct effect on the number of achenes per head, indicating cause-effect relation and becoming an important alternative for indirect selection of sunflower cultivars.},

The aims of this study were to: (i) evaluate the agronomic performance of soybean (Glycine max L.) cultivars growing in second-harvest during the summer; and (ii) evaluate the genetic divergence of the cultivars based on qualitative and quantitative traits. To do this, 18 soybean cultivars were evaluated in three field trials, sown during January in the northwestern region of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. In each experiment, a randomized block design with four replicates was used. Five quantitative traits (representing the agronomic performance of the cultivars) and 12 qualitative traits (morphological descriptors) were assessed aiming at studying the genetic divergence. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated using mixed models and BLUPs for genotypes were estimated for each quantitative trait. The cultivars FPS Igua{\c{c}}u RR and BMX Turbo RR have good agronomic performance and are, based on quantitative and qualitative traits, genetically distant. These cultivars have shown agronomic features that allow their cultivation in the second-harvest in the northwestern of Rio Grande do Sul in addition to be potential genitors for future soybean breeding programs.},

abstract = {Additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) are popular methods for analyzing multi‐environment trials (MET). The AMMI has nice graphical tools for modeling genotype‐vs.‐environment interaction (GEI) but fails in some aspects, such as accommodating a linear mixed‐effect model (LMM) structure. The BLUP provides reliable estimates but new insights to deal graphically with a random GEI structure are needed. This article compares the predictive success of BLUP and AMMI, shows how to generate biplots for modeling GEI in MET analysis using LMM, and proposes a new quantitative genotypic stability measure called WAASB, which is the Weighted Average of Absolute Scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of BLUPs for the GEI effects generated by an LMM. We also introduced the theoretical basis of a superiority index that allows weighting between mean performance and stability, which was conveniently called WAASBY. The BLUP was found to outperform AMMI in the analysis of four real MET trials. The application of our indexes is illustrated using an oat (Avena sativa L.) MET dataset. It was shown that reliable measures of stability using WAASB may help breeders and agronomists to make correct decisions when selecting or recommending genotypes. In addition, the simultaneous selection index, WAASBY, will be useful when the selection should consider different weights for stability and mean performance. Some advantages over existing statistics are discussed. Finally, the implementation of the procedures of this article in future studies is facilitated by an R package containing all required functions.},

abstract = {Modeling the genotype × environment interaction (GEI) and quantifying genotypic stability are crucial steps for selecting/recommending genotypes in multi‐environment trials (METs). The efficiency in selection/recommendation could be greater if based on multiple traits, but identifying genotypes that combine high performance and stability across many traits has been a difficult task. In this study, we propose a multi‐trait stability index (MTSI) for simultaneous selection considering mean performance and stability (MPE) in the analysis of METs using both fixed and mixed‐effect models. Data from an MET where 14 traits were assessed in 22 genotypes of Avena sativa L. were used to illustrate the application of the method. The genotypic stability was quantified for each trait using the weighted average of absolute scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of best linear unbiased predictions for the GEI effects generated by an linear mixed‐effect model (WAASB) index (lower is better). A superiority index, WAASBY (higher is better) was calculated to consider the MPE. The selection differential for the WAASBY index ranged from 9.7 to 44.6{\%}. Positive selection differential (1.75{\%} ≤ selection differential ≤ 17.8{\%}) were observed for trait means that wanted to increase and negative (–11.7{\%}) for one variable that wanted to reduce. The negative selection differential observed for WAASB (–63{\%} ≤ selection differential ≤ −12{\%}) suggested that the selected genotypes were more stable. The MTSI should be useful for breeders and agronomists who desire a selection for MPE based on multiple traits because it provides a robust and easy‐to‐handle selection process, accounting for the correlation structure of the traits. The application of the MTSI in future studies is facilitated by a step‐by‐step guide and an R package containing useful functions.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to characterize black oat populations by estimating between- and within-populations variance components and genetic parameters, as well as to distinguish the populations using multivariable statistics. The experiment was carried out in randomized blocks design with three repetitions, with 14 black oat populations collected in several municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul state. Agronomic important traits were assessed at physiological maturation stage. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated considering within-block information. In addition, Mahalanobis distance, relative contribution of traits, and canonical variables were used to distinguish the populations. Selection based on panicle length, number of grains per panicle, panicle weight and panicle grain weight may result in higher selection gains. Panicle grain weight presents a greater contribution to genetic divergence between studied populations. The formation of distinct groups indicated the presence of genetic variability among black oat populations in the northwestern of the Rio Grande do Sul state. Directed crosses between individual plants of populations from (i) Alto Alegre and Salvador das Miss{\~{o}}es, Chapada, or Santa Rosa or (ii) between plants of populations from Salvador das Miss{\~{o}}es and Campos Borges or Santa Rosa can generate segregating populations with great genetic variability. The predominance of between-phenotypic variance and a within-genetic variance indicate prospects for success in selection gain and possible selection of a new cultivar with fewer efforts compared to a cross-based method. This is supported by the high values of within-population heritability.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to use growth models as an alternative analysis of experiments with tomatoes. The data were obtained from field experiments of tomatoes carried out in the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 growing seasons. Six and nine harvests were carried out in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, respectively. In each harvest, the number and mass of fruits per plant were assessed. The ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to analysis of the data, and the residuals were assessed. Also for each variable, the Brody, Gompertz, Logistic and von Bertalanffy growth models were fitted as a function of the accumulated values per plant in each harvest and days after the transplant of the seedlings. The assumptions of normality, homogeneity and independence of residuals were verified by the Shapiro-Wilk, Breusch-Pagan and Durbin-Watson tests, respectively. The bias of the parameters was evaluated by the intrinsic and parametric nonlinearity, by the difference between OLS-based and the mean of 10.000 bootstrap-based parameter estimates, and by evaluating the symmetry of the sampling distributions of such parameters. Among the models tested, the one that presented a high coefficient of determination and less non-linearity was selected. The parameters of the selected model were compared by the F test. From the second-, third- and fourth-order derivatives with respect to x (days after transplant), the maximum acceleration point, inflection point, maximum deceleration point, and point of asymptotic deceleration were estimated. The residuals increased with the mean when ANOVA was used, and the data transformation did not fix the violated assumption. The violation of the model's assumptions motivated us to propose nonlinear models as an alternative to statistical analysis with ANOVAs. The logistic model had parameters close to being unbiased, and all assumptions have been meeting. Due to this, the logistic model was selected. The critical points of this model allowed assessing the productive precocity, crop concentration period and productive behavior of the genotypes during the productive period. Finally, we have shown that growth models may be an interesting alternative to standard ANOVA procedures to analyze experiments with horticultural crops in future studies.},

abstract = {Nonlinear growth models have been widely used for analyzing production curves with a sigmoidal pattern; however, all benefits that these models provide are not being fully exploited. Our aim here is to provide a step‐by‐step guide on how to choose a nonlinear model with parameters close to being unbiased, and to show how to estimate and interpret the critical points of a model aimed at determining the precocity and concentration of the production. Data on two uniformity trials conducted with eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) was used for this purpose. The Brody, Gompertz, logistic, and von Bertalanffy models were fitted to predict the number and fresh mass of fruits per plant. The model with lower nonlinearity measures and lower bias of the parameter estimates was selected. All the tested models presented satisfactory goodness‐of‐fit measures, but they differed regarding nonlinearity measures. The logistic model was selected because it had lower intrinsic and parametric nonlinearity and lower bias in parameter estimates. The inflection point and maximum acceleration/deceleration points of this model provide detailed pieces of information of the production through the productive cycle. Finally, using the logistic model as an example, we demonstrate that lower values of $\beta$2 are related to an earlier maximum production rate, and higher values of $\beta$3 are related to an earlier production that is concentrated in fewer days. The nonlinearity measures were important for the model selection. Thus, it is strongly recommended that nonlinearity is estimated and used to select nonlinear models in future studies.},

abstract = {Due to the increasing consumption of eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), research should be carried out with this horticultural species aiming at providing technical recommendations for increasing production and quality of fruits. The aim of this study was to estimate the plot and sample size, as well the number of replications suitable for eggplant trials. Two uniformity trials were performed with eggplant in a plastic tunnel. The fresh fruit weight and the total number of fruits were assessed in each basic unit and in each harvest. The harvests were analyzed individually and grouped. Heterogeneity was found among crop rows and individual harvests within the same row. However, when the harvests were grouped, this fact was not observed. When the harvests are grouped, there was a reduction in plot size and sample needed the grouping of six harvests presented the smallest sample size and plot size. The plot size is five plants, the sample is nine plants in the direction of the crop row with a half-range of the 20{\%} confidence interval. Aiming at achieving a minimum-significant difference in the Tukey's test of 30{\%} of treatment mean, three replications with five plants each plot is needed.},

Different parameterizations of the Logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy models were adjusted for number and weight of fruits per plant (g) accumulated in multiple harvests. The model adjustment and parameter estimation were obtained by ordinary least squares, using a Gauss Newton algorithm. The selection of the best model was chosen by intrinsic and parametric nonlinearity. Among the adjusted nonlinear models, the best adjustment for both variables was achieved by the parameterization 2 of the Logistic model and parameterization 1 of the Gompertz model, because they had lower results with less parametric and intrinsic nonlinearity. However, care should be taken when using the Gompertz model because it tends to overestimate the production estimate and may cause misunderstandings in interpretation.},

Thus, our aim was to study the variability of the fresh mass in lettuce shoot, growing in protected environment, and to verify the border effect and size of the experimental unit in minimizing the productive variability. Data from two uniformity trials carried out in a greenhouse in autumn and spring growing seasons were used. In the statistical analyses, it was considered the existence of parallel cultivation rows the lateral openings of the greenhouse and of columns perpendicular to these openings. Different scenarios were simulated by excluding rows and columns to generate several borders arrangements and also to use different sizes of the experimental unit. For each scenario, homogeneity test of variances between remaining rows and columns was performed, and it was calculated the variance and coefficient of variation. There is variability among rows in trials with lettuce in plastic greenhouses and the border use does not bring benefits in terms of reduction of the coefficient of variation or minimizing the cases of heterogeneous variances among rows. In experiments with lettuce in a plastic greenhouse, the use of an experimental unit size greater than or equal to two plants provides homogeneity of variances among rows and columns and, therefore, allows the use of a completely randomized design.},

Different sources and nitrogen management (N) may increase the availability, absorption, and assimilation of this nutrient by plants, favoring the N accumulation in grains. However, little is known about the influence of these factors on the physiological quality of wheat seeds (Triticum aestivum L.). In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the response of different sources and nitrogen fertilization, applied in cover, on the physiological quality of the wheat seeds. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized block design in a split-design treatment plot with three cultivars of wheat (TBIO Mestre, TBIO Igua{\c{c}}u and Quartzo), three sources of nitrogen (urea, ammonium nitrate, and liquid urea), applied using five methods: (I: tilling; II: tilling and booting; III: tilling and flowering; IV: booting and flowering and V: tilling, booting and flowering). The nitrogen partitioning between booting and flowering stages results in higher physiological seed quality, since it increases the percentage of germination by 4{\%} and positively influences the germination count, shoot length, and seedling dry mass. The sources of nitrogen ammonia nitrate and the urea liquid source are equated with urea in relation to the effect on the physiological quality of the seeds, being interesting alternatives to reduce the production cost. The TBIO Mestre and Quartzo cultivars showed seeds with higher physiological quality, due to the greater length of radicle and percentage of germination.},

We also aimed to propose cause and effect of relationships for grain yield components in soybean genotypes under several environmental conditions. The tests were conducted in the agricultural year of 2013/2014 in four growing sites in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The experimental arrangement was randomized blocks in factorial scheme (11 × 4), consisting eleven soybean genotypes in four environments with four repetitions each. All the growing environments Tapera-RS, Derrubadas-RS and Frederico Westphalen-RS were classified as favorable for soybean cultivation. The traits such as total number of pods per plant, number of branches and number of pods with 2-3 grains showed significant linear correlations with grain yield in both methods of analysis. The path analysis was applied under favorable and unfavorable environments to accurately estimate the direct and indirect effect of traits on soybean grain yield. The mass of a thousand grains and plant height were highly associated with grain yield but mostly influenced by environmental effects. The total number of pods should be prioritized for selecting superior soybean genotypes due to its direct and indirect effects on grain yield. It has shown constant in all environmental conditions. The direct effects of number of branches and number of pods (with one grain) presented distinct effects on yield in favorable and unfavorable environments.},

Eight-four clones, with three years of age, from the genetic breeding program of the company CMPC Celulose Riograndense were used. Three field experiments were carried out in a randomized complete block design, in an 84x3 factorial arragement, with 20 replicates of one plant per plot. The clones were evaluated as to diameter at breast height, plant height, and volume of wood. The methods of Annicchiarico and Lin {\&} Binns are highly correlated with each other, and their use together with the method of Wricke is a sound strategy for the evaluation of eucalyptus clones. The factor analysis identified broadly adaptable clones, and some of them were the same ones identified by the methods of Annicchiarico and Lin {\&} Binns.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of N split and different type of urea on important agronomic traits of the maize crop. A randomized complete block design in a 2×2+1 factorial treatment design with four replications was used. The factorial levels were composed of two types of urea (common and coated) and two nitrogen splits (V 3 and V 3 +V 8 ), plus the control treatment (without urea application). Important agronomic traits such as grain yield, biological productivity, and yield components were assessed. It was verified that there is no difference between the common or coated urea on grain yield and its components. On the other hand, the split of nitrogen into V 3 and V 8 stages is an efficient strategy to improve grain yield as well as important features as the number of rows per ears and harvest index. Thus, by using this management system farmers can achieve a more efficient nitrogen use.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to verify physiological quality of black oat populations, in order to know and point out the relationships among physiological characters for selection of progenies. The experiment was carried out at the Laboratory of Plant Breeding and Production, Federal University of Santa Maria, Campus of Frederico Westphalen - RS. Seed samples were collected from 14 black oat populations from small producers in the region, and cultivars BRS Madrugada and BRS Centauro (populations 15 and 16, respectively). A randomized block design with four replications was used. It was evaluated seed length, seed width, thousand seed weight, percentage of germination, non-germinated seeds, abnormal seedlings, hypocotyl length, root length, dry matter of seedlings. Populations revealed a difference in the physiological quality of seeds, and populations 1, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, with germination within the required standard, have a greater potential to compose progenies. Seed width, thousand seed weight, dry matter of seedlings and hypocotyl length revealed association with germination. It is worth highlighting that seed width and thousand seed weight are characters of easy and immediate measurement that can guarantee greater efficiency of selection.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in suboptimal or super-optimal levels can modify the biomass accumulation, bromatological composition and appearance of crops. This study was conducted in a hydroponic system to determine whether PPFD could change physiological and bromatological aspects of escarole (Cichorium endivia L. var. latifolia). Three PPFD levels (100{\%}, 70{\%} and 50{\%} of PPFD) were investigated to determine crop's responses to this factor. Plants of escarole grown under 50{\%} of incident PPFD had converted 0.88g of dry matter per mol of incident photosynthetically active radiation (42{\%} more efficient compared to unshaded environment), had 26{\%} more lipid content, higher levels of chlorophyll a, b and total (12{\%}, 14{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively), 42{\%} less acid detergent fiber, 34{\%} less cellulose, 47{\%} less lignin, lesser leaf thickness and better visual features. The attenuation of PPFD in sites or seasons where there is high light intensity is an effective method to improve morphological, bromatological and visual characteristics of escarole.},

abstract = {The variability within rows of cultivation may reduce the accuracy of vegetables trails; however, little is known about this variability in protected environments. This study aimed at to assess the variability in greenhouses cultivated with Cucurbita pepo and Capsicum annuum and to verify the effect of borders use and plot size in minimizing this variability. Data from two uniformity trials each crop were used. For statistical analysis, the total of productivity by plant was used, considering the plants arranged in parallel crop rows the lateral openings of the greenhouse and the same plants arranged in columns perpendicular to these openings. Different scenarios were designed by excluding rows and columns to generate the borders in different plot sizes. For each scenario, a variance homogeneity test was performed among the remaining rows and columns and the variance and coefficient of variation were calculated. There is variability among rows and columns in trials with C. pepo and C. annuum in greenhouses and the use of borders does not bring benefits in terms of reduction of the coefficient of variation or reduction of cases of variances heterogeneity among rows or columns. The use of a plot size greater than or equal to or two plants for trials with C. pepo and ten plants for trials with C. annuum provides homogeneity of variances among rows and columns enabling the use of the completely randomized design.},

abstract = {The consumer market's demand and requirement for wheat grains which present a satisfactory industrial quality have driven the demand for enhanced cropping systems, especially related to nutritional aspects. In this context, the purpose of this research was to evaluate how the sulfur supplementation and the usage of nitrogen (N) affect the baking quality and the yield of the wheat grain cultivar TBIO Itaipu{\textregistered}. A randomized block experimental design in factorial arrangement, with two sulfur managements (with and without) and four split nitrogen managements (I: 100{\%} of N in the double ring; II: 30{\%} of N in the tillering period + 40{\%} of N in the double ring + 30{\%} of N in the ear development; III: 50{\%} of N in the tillering period + 50{\%} of N in the double ring; IV: 50{\%} of N in the double ring + 50{\%} of N in the ear development period), arranged in four repetitions. Our results showed that the sulfur supplementation increased the gluten content, which has been positively correlated with the strength and extensibility of the bread dough. This had a positive influence on the technological parameters of the flour used for baking. The splitnitrogen fertilizer application (in double ring, tillering, and ear development) increased the wheat grain yield due to the greater number of tillers per plant and also of the wheat ears per square meter.},

abstract = {Under natural conditions, the plants are, usually, surrounded by a series of potential enemies. They had created strategies of defense against pathogens and herbivores{\&}{\#}39; attacks, allowing its perpetuation throughout evolution. These defense mechanisms are closely associated with the synthesis of secondary metabolites, which are also worldwide used in several areas of industry. This bibliographic review was conducted aiming to better understand how plants synthesize these substances in response to biotic or abiotic stimuli. The results discussed here revealed that synthesis of plant secondary metabolites is dependent on changes in several metabolic pathways, being often directly associated with the primary metabolism. Injury by herbivores or pathogens, temperature, CO2 levels, solar radiation and drought, are the factors related to the environment that express the most significant signs of inhibition or synthesis of plant secondary metabolites. Global climatic changes recently observed can affect the metabolic pathways network and, consequently, secondary metabolites synthesis. Nowadays, genomic tools have been useful alternatives that are leading to a new revolution of plant breeding, allowing the overexpression or inhibition of these substances. Some limitations and challenges to be achieved upon the dynamics of secondary metabolite synthesis in plants are presented. Key words: Jasmonic acid, transcription factors, inhibition, synthesis.},

abstract = {Information about data arrangement methodologies and optimal sample size in estimating the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) among maize traits are still limited. Furthermore, some data arrangement methodologies currently used may be increasing multicollinearity in multiple regression analysis. This study aimed to investigate the statistical behavior of the r and the multicollinearity of correlation matrices among maize traits in different data arrangement scenarios and different sample sizes. Data from 45 treatments [15 simple maize hybrids (Zea mays L.) conducted in three locations] were used. Eleven traits were accessed and three datasets (scenarios) were formed: (1) Coming from all the sampled observations (plants), n = 900; (2) Coming from the average of five plants per plot, n = 180; and (3) Coming from the average of treatments, n = 45. A thousand estimates of r were held in each scenario to 60 sample sizes by bootstrap simulations with replacement. Confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. One hundred eighty correlation matrices were estimated and the condition number (CN) calculated. Data coming from average values of plots and average values of treatments overestimates the r up to 24 and 34{\%}, resulting in an increase of 24 and 131{\%} in the matrices' CN. Trait pairs with high r require a smaller number of plants, being the CI inversely proportional to the magnitude of the r. Two hundred and ten plants are sufficient to estimate the r in the CI of 95{\%} {\textless} 0.30. Key words: Average values, bootstrap, confidence intervals, sample tracking, Zea mays L.},

This critical review discusses some systematic errors that have been observed in estimating of correlation coefficients and its possible impacts on accuracy of path analysis. In a first moment, an approach about the maize crop, origin, characteristics and biometric models commonly used in genetic breeding of this crop is presented. Some obstacles found in estimates of path coefficients and the methods used to adjust them are discussed. We also present evidences and a theoretical explanation that some data arrangement methods currently used, may be overestimating the correlation coefficients in scientific studies. Data from a literature search revealing the accuracy of path analysis of some research are presented and discussed. In a last moment, we present a future perspective about how the correct estimate of the correlation coefficients may improve the accuracy of path analysis, underscoring the need for research directed to this objective.},
